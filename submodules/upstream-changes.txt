    Fix memory leaks in linux/hidraw implementation.
    
    Zbigniew Czapiga noticed that some of the udev objects in linux/hid.c weren't
    being freed properly.

    linux/Makefile: Add support for cross compilation
    
    0. VDR`s `Makefile` was taken as a template [1].
    1. Separate variables for flags for `CC` and `CXX` were introduced. `-c` is now passed explicitly. Further flags for `CXX` could be added like in VDRâ€™s `Makefile`.
    2. Separate variable `INCLUDES` defined which is only used for the libraries(?).

    Add ioctl definitions
    
    Added the HIDIOCSFEATURE and HIDIOCGFEATURE ioctl macros to hid.c so that it
    will compile with older kernel headers. This of course doesn't make it _run_
    with older kernels. Some distros ship older kernel headers than the running
    kernel.

    hid_read_timeout() (Linux and Windows).
    
    hid_read_timeout() will execute a blocking read up until a timeout has been
    reached or data has been received.
    
    This patch implements it on all platforms and comes from Urs Fleisch.

    Re-design of hid_read().
    
    This fixes the performance issue caused by calling CancelIo() when no data arrives in asynchronous (non-blocking) mode. Reported by Bill Good.
    
    This new design also fixes the race condition causing lost packets that can happen if data comes between the time when the Event was checked (WaitForSingleObject()) and the CancelIo() call. Reported by Hans Van Leemputten.
