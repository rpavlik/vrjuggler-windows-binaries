# Revision 1.4  2000/01/13 15:56:34  djs
# Factored out private identifier prefix rather than hard coding it all through
# the code.
#

# Added important comment :)
#

# Skeleton of dynamic skeleton code :)
#

# All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe
# is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you
# start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated
# in the first place.       Douglas Adams, "Mostly Harmless"
