/**
 * @example "Example of using cluster::UserData<T>"
 *
 * If MyType all ready derives from vpr::SerializableObject, use the following:
 *
 * \code
 * cluster::UserData<MyType> mMyData;
 * \endcode
 *
 * This will be the usage when MyType is defined as part of the application.
 *
 * When it is necessary to add serialization capabilities to a third-party
 * type that does not derive from vpr::SerializableObject, the generic type
 * vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<T> must be used.  In this case, specializations
 * of the member functions readObject() and writeObject() must be written.
 *
 * For example, assume that MyType is defined in a third-party library as
 * follows:
 *
 * \code
 * struct MyType
 * {
 *    unsigned short something;
 *    bool drawBool;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * Specialization of the methods of vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<T> would
 * then be written as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * template<>
 * void
 * vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<MyType>::writeObject(vpr::ObjectWriter* writer)
 * {
 *    writer->writeUint16(something);
 *    writer->writeBool(drawBool);
 * }
 *
 * template<>
 * void
 * vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<MyType>::readObject(vpr::ObjectReader* reader)
 * {
 *    something = reader->readUint16();
 *    drawBool  = reader->readBool();
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that the method implementations have direct access to the data
 * members of MyType.  More generally, the implementations have access to
 * all public and protected members of the type used for specialization.
 *
 * The instantiation of cluster::UserData<T> would then appear as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * cluster::UserData<vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<MyType> > mMyData;
 * \endcode
 *
 * Access to the shared data cannot occur until after the method
 * cluster::UserData<T>::init() is invoked.  Any access attempts prior to
 * invoking this method will result in a NULL pointer dereference.
 *
 * For more detailed documentation, refer to the VR Juggler 2.0 Programmer's
 * Guide, found under http://www.vrjuggler.org/vrjuggler/docs.php
 *
 * For more information about object serialization and GUID objexts, refer to
 * the VR Juggler Portable Runtime Programmer's Guide and Reference Manual,
 * both of which are found under http://www.vrjuggler.org/vapor/docs.php
