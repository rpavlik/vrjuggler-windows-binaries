/** \class ConfigManager ConfigManager.h jccl/RTRC/ConfigManager.h
 *
 * Dynamic reconfiguration management for JCCL.  The Config Manager provides
 * a complete solution for configuring an application via JCCL's ConfigElement
 * type.  The Config Manager can configure based on static configuration
 * files  or dynamically via a network interface.
 *
 * The Config Manager can be used in a number of ways; it provides a complete
 * default solution to configuration, but also exposes enough of its inner
 * workings to allow applications to implement their own dynamic configuration
 * algorithms.
 *
 * The simplest way to use the Config Manager is to create one or more types
 * that implement the jccl::ConfigElementHandler interface and to register
 * instances of these using the method
 * jccl::ConfigManager::addConfigElementHandler().
 *
 * Requests to add config elements can be added via the network or by the
 * addPending*() methods of this class.  These requests are added to the
 * Config Manager's "pending" list.  The Config Manager also maintains an
 * "active" list, containing all the config elements that have been
 * successfully configured.
 *
 * Once config element handlers have been registered with the Config Manager,
 * the application should periodically call the method
 * jccl::ConfigManager::attemptReconfiguration().  This will try to match items
 * in the pending list with instances of jccl::ConfigElementHandler that know
 * how to handle them.
 *
 * For more advanced uses, jccl::ConfigManager provides accessor functions that
 * allow direct manipulation of the pending and active lists.  This allows an
 * application to decide on its own when and how to process requests in the
 * pending list.  However, the attemptReconfiguration() interface should be
 * sufficient for almost all uses.
