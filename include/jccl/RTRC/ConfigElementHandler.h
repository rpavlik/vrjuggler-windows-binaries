 * Abstract base class for all classes that can handle ConfigElement objects.
 * Any class supporting this interface can be dynamically reconfigured by
 * the JCCL Configuration Manager.
 *
 * The idea is that a subclass overrides configCanHandle() to recognize those
 * elements types that the derived class cares about.  Then override
 * configAdd() and configRemove() to process instances of those elements.
 *
 * The actual work of checking the list of pending add and remove requests
 * and passing them to the methods of this interface is done by
 * configProcessPending().  This can also be overriden to provide special
 * behavior, but this is strongly discouraged.  The default implementation
 * should be sufficient for almost any conceivable dynamic reconfiguration
 * need.
