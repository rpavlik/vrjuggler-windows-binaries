 *
 * vrj::direct3d::App encapulates an actual Direct3D application object.
 * This defines the base class from which Direct3D-based application classes
 * should be derived.  The interface given is what the kernel and the Direct3D
 * Draw Manager expect in order to interact with the application.
 *
 * The control loop will look similar to this:
 *
 * \code
 * d3dapp_obj->contextInit();        // called for each context
 * while (drawing)
 * {
 *    d3dapp_obj->preFrame();
 *    d3dapp_obj->latePreFrame();
 *    d3dapp_obj->bufferPreDraw();   // called for each draw buffer
 *    d3dapp_obj->contextPreDraw();  // called for each context
 *    d3dapp_obj->draw();            // called for each viewport
 *    d3dapp_obj->contextPostDraw(); // called for each context
 *    d3dapp_obj->intraFrame();      // called in parallel to the draw functions
 *    sync();
 *    d3dapp_obj->postFrame();
 *
 *    updateAllDevices();
 * }
 *
 * d3dapp_obj->contextClose();       // called for each context
 * \endcode
 *
 * @note One time through the loop is a Juggler Frame.
 *
 * @see vrj::App, vrj::Kernel
 *
 * @since 2.1.16
 *
 * @note This class was renamed from vrj::D3dApp in VR Juggler 2.3.11.
