 * that accept a strategy for determining the affinity for render threads.
 * This implementation examines an environment variable (the name of which is
 * VJ_DRAW_THREAD_AFFINITY by default) that must contain a space-separated
 * list of integers identifying the CPU affinity ordering. For each thread
 * that the Draw Manager creates, the affinity will be returned. If more
 * threads are created than there are CPUs identified by the environment
 * variable, then the affinity assignment simply starts over at the beginning
 * of the list.

 * @since 2.3.14
