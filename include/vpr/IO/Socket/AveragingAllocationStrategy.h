 *
 * This allocation strategy, designed specifically for use with
 * vpr::NoPushWriter, keeps a sliding window of allocation sizes. When
 * called, the maximum of the average allocation size and the required
 * allocation size is returned. The intention is that this class can be used
 * when many write operations are performed on a socket with the sizes of
 * those writes varying frequently. Ideally, the averaging will allocate a
 * buffer that is big enough during the corked time frame that it will not
 * require reaallocation during that time and will not be too much larger
 * than is strictly necessary.
 *
 * @note Using an average to achieve the stated goals may be naive.
