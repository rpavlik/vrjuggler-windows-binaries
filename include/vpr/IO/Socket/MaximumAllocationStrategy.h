 * track of the maximum amount of memory allocated while the socket is in the
 * no-push ("corked") state. When queried, the maximum memory allocation value
 * thus far is returned as the amount to allocate. This strategy is suitable
 * for a case when a socket is used for writing roughly the same amount of
 * data repeatedly. Copying due to reallocation will be minimized (once the
 * maximum send size while corked is determined), but memory usage will be
 * less efficient if there is significant deviation of data written to the
 * socket while corked.
