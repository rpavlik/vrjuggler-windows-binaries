 * existing type by defining just two methods.
 *

 *
 * \code
 * void
 * vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<MyType>::writeObject(vpr::ObjectWriter* writer)
 * { ... }
 *
 * void
 * vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<MyType>::readObject(vpr::ObjectReader* writer)
 * { ... }
 * \endcode
 *
 * A serializable instance of \c MyType can then be declared as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * vpr::SerializableObjectMixin<MyType> mSerializableMyType;
 * \endcode
 *
 * @see vpr::ObjectWriter, vpr::ObjectReader
