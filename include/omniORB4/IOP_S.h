  $Log: IOP_S.h,v $
  Revision 1.1.4.1  2003/03/23 21:04:18  dgrisby
  Start of omniORB 4.1.x development branch.

  Revision 1.1.2.4  2001/09/20 11:30:59  sll
  On the server, the final state of a GIOP_S is ReplyCompleted instead of
  Idle. This is necessary because the idle connection management code
  treats Idle as a state where the idle counter can be restarted.

  Revision 1.1.2.3  2001/09/10 17:41:30  sll
  Added WaitForRequestHeader in IOP_S::State. Reorder the enum labels inside
  IOP_S::State, any label that is larger than WaitForRequestHeader now
  indicates that the IOP_S is actively processing a request.

  Revision 1.1.2.2  2001/05/02 14:20:15  sll
  Make sure that getStream() is used instead of casting to get a cdrStream
  from a IOP_C and IOP_S.

  Revision 1.1.2.1  2001/04/18 17:26:29  sll
  Big checkin with the brand new internal APIs.

  // The dispatcher() encapsulates the upcall to the stub level dispatcher
  // with a try block that catches all system exceptions. The exception
  // handlers deal with an exception according to the state of the IOP_S
  // at the time:
  //
  //    1. If a system exception is caught when arguments are unmarshalled or
  //       results are marshalled, i.e. the IOP_S is either in
  //         RequestIsBeingProcessed or ReplyIsBeingComposed,
  //       something is seriously wrong in the marshalling or unmarshalling
  //       and cannot recover without destroying the strand. The destructor
  //       is called with the state unchanged.
  //
  //    2. If a system exception is caught while the strand is in
  //       WaitingForReply, the dispatcher() would completed internally the
  //       reply sequence and propagate the exception back to the client.
  //
  // The destructor examines the state, if it is *not* in Idle, there is
  // something seriously wrong with the cdrStream. Also the state
  // of the strand, on which the cdrStream is built, is unknown.
  // For this reason, the strand is marked as dying by the destructor. The
  // destructor may be called multiple times. It simply returns if the instance
  // is already in Zombie state.
  //
  // Calling the member functions RequestReceived(), InitialiseReply() and
  // ReplyCompleted() while the IOP_S is not in the appropriate state as
  // indicated above would cause a CORBA::INTERNAL() exception to be raised.
