/** \class SampleBuffer SampleBuffer.h gadget/Type/SampleBuffer.h
 *
 * Buffer class for data from input devices. Instances of this class store
 * typed samples in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue with a maximum size.
 * The most recent sample is always at the \em end of the queue.
 *
 * There are two buffers (each a vector of vectors of samples): the "ready"
 * and the "stable" samples:
 *
 *   -# Stable: Samples that the user-level code access. There is one entry
 *              in this buffer for each frame of the application.
 *   -# Ready:  Samples that have been completed and could be swapped over to
 *              current.
 *
 * The first index level of the stable vector of vectors is for each frame of
 * the application. The Input Manager tells each device to swap its ready
 * buffers into its stable buffers once per frame. Thus, for each frame, a new
 * set of stable buffers is added for each device.
 *
 * The second index level of both buffers is for the collection of input units
 * on a given device. For example, a three-button mouse without a scroll
 * wheel or roller ball will have three digital input units (one for each
 * button) and two analog input units (one for the X and one for the Y
 * dimensions of movement).
 *
 * Thus, a basic mouse driver would utilize two instantiations of this type:
 * gadget::SampleBuffer<gadget::DigitalData,5000> and
 * gadget::SampleBuffer<gadget::AnalogData,5000> (assuming that the default
 * maximum buffer size is used). Depending on the time of querying (and
 * whether the device is properly producing input data) there would be between
 * 0 and 5000 first-level indices for both sample buffer instances. The
 * second-level vector would have exactly 3 indices of gadget::DigitalData
 * objects and exactly 2 indices of gadget::AnalogData objects.
 *
 * As a simple example of how this type is used, see the methods
 * gadget::Digital::addDigitalSample(), gadget::Digital::swapDigitalBuffers(),
 * and gadget::Digital::getDigitalData(). The first two methods are invoked by
 * all \em subclasses of gadget::Digital (drivers for devices that supply
 * digital input). The third is used by gadget::DigtialProxy::updateData() to
 * get the most recent stable samples for a given digital device unit.
 *
 * @note The buffers can be empty at the start, but after the first cycle
 *       (first time stable gets values) the Stable buffer must have at least
 *       one sample.
 *
 * @tparam DATA_TYPE       The type of the samples stored by the instanation
 *                         of this template type.
 * @tparam MAX_BUFFER_SIZE The maximum allowable size of the buffers. After
 *                         the buffer reaches this size, old samples are
 *                         discarded from the \em front of the queue.
