 *
 * gadget::Input is the abstract base class from which all input objects
 * derive.
 *
 * gadget::Input is the base class for all Input Devices, all the devices are
 * therefore forced to implement the pure virtual functions of sample(),
 * startSampling(), stopSampling(), and updateData().
 *
 * Dummy devices can use a default constructor, but physical devices should
 * have a Constructor which takes a config element and calls the Input
 * constructor taking a jccl::ConfigElementPtr.
 *
 * All Physical devices will inherit from not Input but another abstract
 * class which inherits from Input, currently there is support for
 * Positional Devices, Analog Devices, and Digital devices, each has its own
 * added pure virtual functions providing a simple and equal interface to
 * themselves.
 *
 * @note We make the assumption in all devices that while updateData() is being
 *       called, no other process will try to read the current data.
 *       We can make this assumption because the whole idea of UpdateData() is
 *       to bring in a current copy of the data for threads to process for a
 *       frame.  Because of this, threads should not be reading data while
 *       it is being updated to the most recent copy.
