 * thought of as a map of keyboard and mouse events (presses, releases, and
 * movements) to integers.  The integers indicate the number of times the event
 * occurred since the last update.  That is to say, gadget::KeyboardMouse
 * counts the number of keyboard and mouse events between updates.  Updates in
