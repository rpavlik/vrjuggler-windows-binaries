/** \class InputWindowXWin InputWindowXWin.h gadget/Devices/KeyboardMouseDevice/InputWindowXWin.h
 *
 * X Window System input window class.
 * This device is a source of keyboard events.  The device should not be
 * used directly, it should be referenced through proxies.
 *
 * There are two modes that this device can operate in:
 *
 * 1. Controlling local window
 *
 *    In this mode, the device opens and manages its own X11 window for
 *    getting input.
 *
 * 2. Connecting to remotely management window
 *
 *    In this mode, the device connects through X11 to a
 *    window (and display) that have been opened by
 *    another process (normally a GLX window from VR Juggler).
 *
 * Mouse Locking:
 *
 *  This device recieves input from the XWindows display.  As such,
 *  the xwindow must have focus to generate events.  In order to help
 *  users keep the window in focus, there are two cases where the
 *  driver will "lock" the mouse to the window, thus preventing loss of focus.
 *
 *  CASE 1: The user holds down any key (for example, a, b, ctrl, shift,
 *          etc.).<br>
 *  CASE 2: The user can toggle locking using a special "locking" key
 *          defined in the configuration element.
