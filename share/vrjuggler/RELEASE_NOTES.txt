===============================================================================

 Version: 3.0.0
Released: November 27, 2010

   NOTE: Flagpoll 0.9.4 or newer is required to build this VR Juggler release
         from source code. Version 0.9.1 was the previous minimum required
         version, but recent bug fixes in Flagpoll pertain to ensuring that
         VR Juggler can be built correctly on Mac OS X in all circumstances.

   VR Juggler 3.0 represents the culmination of three years of development and
   testing, and as a result, this is probably the most well tested VR Juggler
   version yet. A great deal of care was taken to ensure that this would be a
   solid release because of its significance. Specifically, VR Juggler 3.0 has
   a totally redesigned cluster infrastructure.

   The new cluster infrastructure is based on a formal client/server model
   rather than the peer-to-peer approach with an ad hoc server used by VR
   Juggler 2.x. The new architecture is vastly more scalable and more
   performant. It should also prove easier to configure in at least two ways.
   First, the server node distributes configuration information to clients
   rather than requiring users to maintain per-machine configuration
   arrangements. Second, it is no longer necessary to identify which cluster
   node is hosting a device because all devices have to be hosted by the
   server.

   Highlights of VR Juggler 3.0 include the following:

      * Support for OpenGL 3.0 contexts.
      * NSPR is no longer a dependency on Windows. Boost.Asio is now used for
        networking, and that means that Boost 1.35.0 is the minimum required
        version of Boost on Windows. Using 1.40.0 or newer is highly
        recommended. For 64-bit Windows builds, 1.40.0 is the minimum
        required version.
      * Use of a CORBA Naming Service by Tweek is now optional as direct
        connections to Subject Manager servants are now supported.
      * VRJConfig now uses a direct connection to the configuration subject
        manager, thus making dynamic run-time reconfiguration easier to
        utilize.
      * Use of reference counted memory (through boost::shared_ptr<T>) has
        been expanded to help protect against dangling references and memory
        leaks. This pertains mostly to input device objects and input proxy
        objects.
      * Simulated analog devices now have an optional "auto-return" feature
        that can be enabled through the configuration.
      * Mouse locking use and behavior within keyboard/mouse input areas
        (i.e., windows) is now more configurable, and it can be controlled by
        application code when necessary.
      * Two new Open Scene Graph application object types have been added:
        vrj::osg::AppViewer and vrj::osg::AppPager. See the documentation for
        the respective classes for more details.
      * The OpenSG application object class, vrj::opensg::App, support both
        OpenSG 1.8 and 2.0. The decision about which API to use is made at
        compile time.
      * Many improvements have been made to the use of Cocoa on Mac OS X.

   There are some "breaking" changes relative to VR Juggler 2.x of which
   application programmers need to be aware. They include the following:

      * The X,Y position for mouse events is now reported using a lower
        left-hand corner origin to match the window positioning convention
        of Juggler.
      * Mouse scroll events in the X and Y axes are now treated as first class
        mouse events rather than pretending that they are button presses.
      * Classes for each Draw Manager implementation now use distinct C++
        namespaces. Backward compatibility typedefs have been included to aid
        with migrating code.

   Finally, this release marks the first time that support for legacy features
   has been removed. The following may be of interest to users with old
   equipment or operating systems:

      * Support for SPROC threads on IRIX has been removed.
      * Support for Mac OS X 10.3 has been removed. 10.4 (Tiger) is now the
        minimum required version.
      * Support for AudioWorks has been removed.
      * Support for Visual C++ 7.1 (.NET 2003) has been dropped.
        Visual C++ 8.0 (2005) is the minimum supported version now.

   As usual, there are changes to configuration files required to take
   advantage of new features. For details in migrating applications and
   configurations from VR Juggler 2.2 to 3.0, please see the migration page
