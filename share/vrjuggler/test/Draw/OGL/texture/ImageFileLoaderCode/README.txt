             more information and usage.

Notes: 
These file loaders are not used by the VR Juggler Texture application example,
but are included for your benefit, and so that the Image and Texture classes 
will be more useful to you.  For example, without this loader, you'd have 
to write your own, or hack another one and probably spend a few hours 
getting the data formats to match so that the Image class would accept it.
This way, (hopefully) you'll spend 0 time to get up and running with 
texturing in your application, and can focus on what's important. :)
