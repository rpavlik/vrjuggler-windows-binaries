This texture example uses "hard-coded" textures via .cpp files.

If you need a tool to load your own image file into the Image class object,
then see the ImageFileLoaderCode directory for code that loads SGI and TGA
image formats.

This auxiliary directory (not used by the application) provides the
vrjuggler user with a way to get started with texturing.  It gives them
the ability to load in two different file formats, each supporting 24bit
or 32bit (with alpha) textures == the SGI format, and the TGA format

For more more image file formats, and image file export (write to disk) see:
