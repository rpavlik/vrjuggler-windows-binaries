Overview
--------

This example creates a VNC desktop viewer and draws it using OpenGL.

The example allows the user to grab, move, and resize the VNC desktop
interactively.

This is not meant to be a full application but is only meant to show how
VNC could be used inside a user application.

Please note that vrj_vnc_app.jdef configuration definition file is in the
local directory.  It is used to create a config element that is needed to
configure the application with the correct VNC desktop parameters.  This
is optional in end-user applications but is provided with this sample to
make it easier to customize the applciation.  In order for VRJConfig and
VR Juggler to find vrj_vnc_app.jdef, the environment variable
JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH must be set to include the absolute path to the
directory containing vrj_vnc_app.jdef.
