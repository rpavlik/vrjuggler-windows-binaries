Wherever you need a sound, place this hierarchy of nodes:

DOF1 (can be named anything)
 |
DOF2 (see below for naming...)
 |
somegeometry

somegeometry: just put a placeholder (such as a sphere), not required, but
makes placing the sound so much easier (since you can see it).

DOF2: determines what the sound is named, I will replace this node
with a Sound node I wrote.  You will edit DOF2's name only (any transforms
will be discarded). Set the name to: YourSound_Sound_.  NOTE: it must be a
DOF node, otherwise I won't find it (mgen wont export it).

DOF1: used for placement of sound in scene.
edit DOF1 to hold the right x/y/z positions for the sound.  watch the
geometry so that you can place it, unless you know a better way. :)

Example:
   if you want hail.aiff. then you will use hail_Sound_ for your sound
   node name.

  
The keyword i am looking for is _Sound_.
If it's not there, then it wont load.


Try not to instance.  It would be cool to have a farm sound, but I think
that wont work (unless we create a name for each one).
