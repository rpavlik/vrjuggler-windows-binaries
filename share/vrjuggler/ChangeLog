                        Submitted by Doug McCorkle.
Feb-06-2011 patrick     Another vrj::Kernel::init() overload has been added.
                        This version accepts an int parameter, parserStyle,
                        that allows the application main() function to
                        influence the Boost.program_options command line parser
                        style.
Feb-06-2011 patrick     An assertion has been added to
                        vrj::Kernel::init(const boost::program_options::variables_map&)
                        to help clarify that the use of
                        vrj::Kernel::getClusterOptions() is a precondition.
Jan-29-2011 patrick     vrj::Kernel::loadConfigFile() now ignores config files
                        given on cluster slave nodes.

                        by the context-specific osgViewer::Viewer object so
                        that the camera does not clear the color buffer or the
                        depth buffer itself.

                        osgUtil::SceneView::Options to unsigned int to fix

                        NEW VERSION: 2.3.12
Jul-08-2007 patrick     Code in the Draw Manager implementations is now in a
                        namespace specific to each implementation, and the
                        classes contained therein no longer have the Draw
                        Manager abbreviation at the start of their name. The
                        namespaces are vrj::opengl (vrj/Draw/OpenGL), vrj::osg
                        (vrj/Draw/OSG), vrj::opensg (vrj/Draw/OpenSG), vrj::pf
                        (vrj/Draw/Pf), and vrj::direct3d (vrj/Draw/Performer).

                        on Windows is now named the same as optimized code.
                        The debug DLLs are installed in the "debug"
                        subdirectory. On non-Windows platforms, debug-enabled
                        plug-ins no longer use the "_d" name variation and are
                        installed in the "debug" subdirectory.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.3.10
Jun-26-2007 patrick     Changed the preprocessor identification of debug versus
                        optimized to look for VJ_DEBUG or JUGGLER_DEBUG
                        instead of _DEBUG (and VJ_OPT or JUGGLER_OPT instead
                        of _OPT).
                        NEW VERSION: 2.3.9

                        vrj::Frustum::getValues() as the accessor for that
                        data.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.3.7
May-06-2007 patrick     Exposed VRJBasicDelegate so that user-level code can
                        derive from it to customize response to Cocoa events.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.3.6
May-04-2007 patrick     Added lighting code to vrj::GlBasicSimulator so that
                        OSG and OpenSG application objects do not have to
                        include that code themselves just so that the simulator
                        renders nicely.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.3.5
