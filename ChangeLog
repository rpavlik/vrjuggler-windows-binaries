[Version 1.2.0 released - 5.1.2011]============================================

2011-04-23 patrickh     SCons 2.0 is now the minimum required version.
                        Submitted by Doug McCorkle.

                        Submitted by: Carsten Neumann
                        VERSION: 1.1.2
2010-03-06 patrickh     Fixed conflicts with the operator<< overload for

                        VERSION: 1.1.1

[Version 1.0.0 released - 3.2.2009]============================================

2007-08-01 patrickh     Updated for SConsAddons changes. On Windows, the
                        build formerly called "hybrid" is now the "debug"
                        build. The DLL is installed in lib\debug. The build
                        formerly called "debug" is now the "debugrt" build (to
                        indicate that it is linked against the Visual C++ debug
                        runtime). The library is still named with "_d".
                        VERSION: 0.7.10

2006-07-05 allenb       More refactoring of build system.
                        It is not possible to specify all variants to build
                        and build them simultaneously.
2006-06-30 allenb       Refatored the build system to support building on Win32
                        using SCons.  This requires an in-development version
                        of scons-addons to get the EnvironmentBuilder.

                        of strings to attributes.
                        Added an attrib() method to Node that returns this map.
                        VERSION: 0.7.2

2005-02-03 allenb       Added tests for Node interface.
                        Added Node::hasChild() method.

2004-04-12 allenb       Moving into active development version again
                        NEW VERSION: 0.5.0

[Version 0.4.0 released - 4.6.2004]============================================
2004-02-29 allenb       Moved the node type enum into Node as Node::Type. 
                        This breaks all old code that used the type interface.
                        To help avoid future breakage in the future, added
                        an interface to Node to query for node type. (isLeaf(),
                        isNode(), isCData(), isDocument()).
2004-02-25 allenb       Modified build to take into account separate boost
                        include directory.
2004-02-21 allenb       Started adding tests for boost spirit parsing.
                        Added options for boost spirit
                        NEW VERSION: 0.3.1
2004-02-20 allenb       Added more extensive tests to test suite.  Added metric
                        tests for loading and parsing documents.
2004-02-14 allenb       Restructure the test suite.  Added StaticOnly option
                        to build.  Added Metric Registry to test suite.

[Version 0.3.0 released - 1.28.2004]===========================================
2004-01-28 patrickh     Restored the ability to compile shared libraries.
2003-10-07 allenb       Added support for "stringification" of attrib text and
                        cdata text.  This makes the system automatically
                        escape any tokens (&<>"') before saving and upon load.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.1
2003-02-20 allenb       Added isEqual method to Node interface.
                        Created test application to test combinations of
                        isEqual comparisons.
2003-02-07 nonchocoboy  Replaced Doozer-based build system with an SCons-based
                        build system.
2003-01-14 allenb       Added debug name member to the Node class.  This member
                        stores the string rep of the Node name but only
                        if CPPDOM_DEBUG is defined.  This member can REALLY
                        help when looking at cppdom code in a debugger.
2003-01-11 allenb       Refactoring exception class.
                        cppdom::Error now tracks a local description of the
                        error as well as the file and line number that the error
                        occurred on.  There is a new macro that helps to
                        construct the Error class to throw.
                        Also fixed the attribute API to throw an exception when
                        passed an invalid attribute name.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
2003-01-11 allenb       Change NodeList type to std::vector instead of std::list
2003-01-11 allenb       Added flags for disabling indentation and/or newlines
                        in node and document saving.
2003-01-11 allenb       Added a simplified interface to cdata.  This new
                        interface allows basic cdata manipulation from the
                        parent element of the actual cdata node.
2003-01-10 allenb       Added an example that makes a tree from scratch.
                        Added node and doc constructors that take the name
                        of the new node.
2003-01-06 allenb       Added general project documentation in the form of
                        .dox files in the doc/dox directory.  Modified doxy
                        config file to parse these files for documentation.
2003-01-03 nonchocoboy  Removed the XML prefix on the class names.
2003-01-02 nonchocoboy  Brought the VC7 build up to date.
                        NEW VERSON: 0.1.0
2003-01-02 nonchocoboy  Moved implementation code out of the headers to make
                        building as a shared library easier.
2003-01-02 nonchocoboy  Removed xml_char_type and XMLString typedefs.
2002-12-02 nonchocoboy  Specialization of XMLAttribute::getValue<T> for
                        std::string added so that more than the first word of
                        the attribute string can be retrieved.
2002-12-02 nonchocoboy  Added versioning information.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.0.1
2002-05-06 subatomic    Added README and build instructions
2002-05-05 subatomic    Brought the code up to coding standard (API changed!).
2002-05-05 subatomic    Added build system based on Doozer gnumake tools
                        support irix, linux, solaris, freebsd, Win32 under
                        Cygwin, probably other too but untested see README.
2002-05-05 allenb       Added save_file method for document node.
2002-05-01 subatomic    Added predicate.h, and two predicates
2002-04-05 allenb       Fix EOF and -1 chars on Irix.
2002-04-03 allenb       Added Node::getChild(char*) to avoid matching templated
                        predicate version.
2002-02-19 allenb       cppdom_boost::shared_ptr (no conflict with real boost)
2002-02-09 subatomic    const correctness, coding style
2002-02-08 subatomic    branched cppdom from 0.6 LGPL version of xmlpp
