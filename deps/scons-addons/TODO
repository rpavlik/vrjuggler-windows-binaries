- Option handling must be improved

There is a problem with the way options and build environments interact in scons-addons.  For example consider how an option should validate and set itself if we are using debug runtimes and compile flags vs. using optimized run-times.

We do not have a good way to take this into account to know what the correct way to use this is.

Release.
